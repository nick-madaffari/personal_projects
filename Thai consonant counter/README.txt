On February 29th, 2020 B.C. (Before Corona) I arrived in Thailand for a 3-month-long
backpacking adventure.

Little did I know that the world would soon change forever.

As Covid-19 cases, civil unrest, and economic turmoil spiked back home in the US,
Covid-free Thailand was the perfect escape. 3 months became a year, and in the
meantime, I decided to learn some Thai and Python (arguably the weirdest combination
of languages on Earth).

Being an ex-engineer, I am all about efficiency. So I decided to write a program that
lets me practice both languages simultaneously, and also tells me which consonants
are most prevalent so I could better focus my efforts on learning those first.
